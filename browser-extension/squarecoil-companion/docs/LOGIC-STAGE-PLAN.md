# SquareCoil Companion Logic Stage Plan

Status: **Completed - L0-L8 settled; implementation dependency gates active**

Companion framework source: `docs/REBUILD-MASTER-PLAN.md`  
Purpose: preserve the completed staged-logic method and map settled contracts to implementation dependencies without treating dependency eligibility as authorization or acceptance proof.

---

## Operating Rule

Logic work should be staged, reviewed, and frozen before the corresponding implementation stage begins.

Do not ask Logic to specify the entire application in one pass.

Each stage should:

1. use the Master Plan as structural authority;
2. define behavior only inside that stage's scope;
3. list assumptions and unresolved questions;
4. identify contradictions with earlier stages;
5. end with an explicit readiness status;
6. avoid coding implementation details unless needed to clarify a contract;
7. produce a small reviewable file that becomes the authority for that behavior area.

Recommended statuses:

- Ready for next logic stage
- Ready for implementation of this stage
- Ready for limited implementation only
- Logic incomplete
- Logic blocked upstream

# Stage L0: Vocabulary, Invariants, and Compatibility Baseline

## Goal

Make sure every later stage uses the same definitions and preserves the intended v0.7.x behavior rather than accidentally preserving bugs.

## Define

- Job vs General context.
- SquareCoil authoritative clock.
- Companion active timer.
- Pending/Resume state.
- Recent vs Archived vs Deleted.
- Session vs accumulated/job total.
- Today vs current session vs Job Total.
- Historical time vs Activity Log.
- Full Backup vs History CSV vs Time Report CSV.
- Runtime state vs restorable history.

## Confirm invariants

- one actual Companion active context;
- tab selection does not clock into SquareCoil;
- SquareCoil company clock is never silently modified by Companion Pause;
- saved historical time cannot be silently pruned;
- restored data cannot claim a live SquareCoil state;
- one UI owner / one state writer;
- Chrome/Edge share one behavior model.

## Output

`logic/L0-INVARIANTS.md`

## Exit condition

Terminology and non-negotiable behavior are unambiguous enough that later stages will not redefine them.

---

# Stage L1: Application Lifecycle and Browser Boot

## Goal

Define what it means for the Companion to be healthy and recoverable.

## Specify

- UNINITIALIZED / BOOTING / READY / DEGRADED / RECOVERING / FAILED transitions;
- what must be true before READY is reported;
- duplicate-runtime prevention;
- stale-root handling;
- extension reload behavior;
- page navigation behavior;
- teardown requirements;
- retry limits and when recovery stops;
- user-visible degraded/failure feedback;
- interaction between isolated extension controller and MAIN-world application where required;
- Chrome/Edge parity expectations.

## Do not specify yet

- detailed timer state transitions;
- archive/CSV behavior;
- final UI styling.

## Output

`logic/L1-LIFECYCLE.md`

## Exit condition

A builder can implement boot, health, teardown, and recovery without inventing lifecycle rules.

---

## Specify

### Timer State

## Output

`logic/L2-STATE-TIME-MIGRATION.md`

## Exit condition

State/ledger queries and migrations can be implemented without individual features inventing their own totals.

The Bridge can be implemented independently and tested against normalized events.

---

- local Pause;
- local Resume;

# Stage L8: Failure Behavior, Acceptance Criteria, and Implementation Handoff

## Goal

Tie the logic stages together and make implementation/build work safe and testable.

## Specify

- migration fixtures;
- backup fixtures;
- regression scenarios;
- exact implementation stage dependencies.

## Output

`logic/L8-ACCEPTANCE-HANDOFF.md`

## Exit condition

Framework + Logic contracts are settled. Build stages are dependency-mapped but remain separately review-, authorization-, and evidence-gated.

---

# Implementation Gate After Logic

Do not begin full implementation merely because L1 is complete.

Dependency eligibility is not implementation authorization and does not prove that a build stage is settled. Use `LOGIC-TRACEABILITY-MATRIX.md` for required A1-A4 gates and `../CODEX-IMPLEMENTATION-HANDOFF.md` for the verified current stage and exact authorization vocabulary.

Logic dependency map; these headings do not authorize implementation. Each stage additionally requires all prior applicable stages to be settled, a read-only stage review, and its exact `START Bn` authorization. At the current checkpoint the next action remains `REVIEW B1`.

### Build Stage B1 logic dependencies: L0-L1

Scaffold, build tooling, lifecycle skeleton, browser boot tests.

### Build Stage B2 logic dependencies: L2-L4

State, migration, SquareCoil bridge, core timer.

Dependency eligibility is not implementation authorization. B2 implementation also requires B1 to be settled, a completed read-only `REVIEW B2`, and separate exact `START B2` authorization.

### Build Stage B3 logic dependency: L5

Time Overview, Recent, History, Job Navigation.

### Build Stage B4 logic dependency: L6

Archive, housekeeping, backup, restore, CSV/reporting.

### Build Stage B5 logic dependency: L7

Themes, Support, Developer Support.

### Chrome candidate acceptance dependency: L8 plus settled B1-B6 gates

Full smoke/acceptance, package, and first Chrome upload candidate require every applicable prior stage gate plus separate candidate/release authorization; L8 completion alone is not permission to create or publish one.

Edge parity follows using the same shared source and parity tests.

---

# Noise-Control Rules

To prevent the project from becoming too noisy:

1. One logic stage per review cycle.
2. Do not mix visual polish with state-machine specification.
3. Do not rewrite settled earlier stages unless a contradiction is found.
4. Put new unresolved questions under an explicit `Open Questions` heading instead of silently answering them.
5. Keep implementation ideas labeled as recommendations, not requirements, unless required by the architecture.
6. Freeze a logic stage once accepted and reference it by file.
7. Update `REBUILD-START-HERE.md` after each accepted stage.
8. Do not advance the Chrome package until the relevant acceptance gates are green.

---

# Logic Handoff Readiness

**Logic handoff complete: L0-L8 settled**

Use the current Codex handoff to locate the authorized build-stage checkpoint. Reopen a settled logic contract only through L8's contradiction/amendment path; do not restart staged logic or treat a later-stage specification as permission for premature implementation.

At logic closure, B1 exists but is not settled, B2 is blocked, and `REVIEW B1` is the next required authorization.
