# US Sign SquareCoil Companion

Current rebuild state: **v0.7.1 B6 release candidate** on `codex/squarecoil-b2c-migration`.

This is one Manifest V3 codebase for installed Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge. B6 is a tested candidate gate, not a production promotion, store publication, or claim that `release.json` has been advanced. SquareCoil remains authoritative for the real company clock; the Companion observes native state and keeps its own Timer/Ledger data.

## Candidate behavior

- one lifecycle runtime and one owned workspace root per eligible document;
- fenced worker authority with one current OWNER and read-only connected observers;
- read-only `action=7` observation plus native action 2/3/4 completion evidence through `chrome.webRequest`;
- final READY only after lifecycle, current authority tenure, migration, trusted core, and Bridge prerequisites settle;
- canonical Timer, Ledger, Today/Week/Context/History views, archives, backup/restore, and CSV tools;
- revisioned Settings, Timer Limits, Light/Dark/Auto, Solid/Glass, and bounded website themes;
- privacy-safe Support/Feedback and fail-closed unavailable Developer Support;
- optional Cinematic and exact Design Dashboard presentation packs, both off by default.

The rebuild does not issue SquareCoil native clock mutations. Duplicate, stale-generation, retired-runtime, and superseded evidence fails closed.

## Validate

From this directory:

```powershell
npm run check:b6-candidate
```

The installed-browser A4 gate requires an exact clean package and ZIP. It runs two isolated profiles in each installed browser:

- `PROFILE-CLEAN` proves a fresh package has no inherited runtime or authority state and preserves every accepted B1-B5-B gate.
- `PROFILE-UPGRADE-V07` proves valid v0.7 data migrates exactly once, the legacy source remains unchanged, no legacy live state is revived, preferences are adopted safely, and READY remains settlement-gated.

See `tests/b1-browser/README.md` for the command and evidence schema. Chrome runs first, followed by Edge, against the same package bytes.

## Package contract

The B6 candidate package contains exactly:

- `manifest.json`
- `dist/background.js`
- `dist/build-info.json`
- `dist/companion-app.js`
- `dist/content-controller.js`
- `dist/popup.js`
- `popup/popup.html`
- `popup/popup.css`

`dist/build-info.json` binds the package to the source commit, clean/dirty state, build ID, stage, version, and candidate fingerprint. The fingerprint is embedded into all three runtime bundles.

## Install the tested candidate

Extract the exact tested ZIP. In `chrome://extensions` or `edge://extensions`, enable Developer mode, choose **Load unpacked**, and select the extracted directory containing `manifest.json`. Do not substitute a working-tree build for an accepted package.

## Safety boundary

All automated installed-browser acceptance uses synthetic in-memory SquareCoil fixtures and blocks unexpected network access. B6 does not authorize live SquareCoil mutations, main-branch integration, store publication, rollout, or production release.

For project constraints and continuation order, read `AGENTS.md`, `logic/L8-ACCEPTANCE-HANDOFF.md`, and `implementation/NEXT-CHAT-HANDOFF.md` before editing.
