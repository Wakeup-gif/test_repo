# US Sign SquareCoil Companion

Current stable package: **v0.7.0 Dual Browser + Glass**.

The Companion is one Manifest V3 codebase packaged and validated for both Microsoft Edge and Google Chrome. It augments the internal US Sign & Mill SquareCoil site with the Job Timer workspace and optional website themes while keeping SquareCoil authoritative for the real company clock.

## What v0.7.0 contains

- Job Timer Light, Dark, and Auto appearance modes.
- Job Timer **Solid** or **Glass / Blur** panel finish. Solid remains the default so an update does not silently change the user's existing visual density.
- Job Workspace Pause/Resume controls. Pause affects the Companion timer only and never clocks the employee out of SquareCoil.
- Direct job links, recent-job delete/archive controls, Archive All, Clear Recent, CSV export/import restore, and full timer-history wipe.
- Website themes: Original, Refined Light, and Sleek Dark.
- Sleek Dark audit overlay that removes inherited bright/white borders and native focus halos from common SquareCoil/AdminDesign components while preserving semantic status colors.
- Sleek Dark custom US Sign logo, sourced from the same known logo used by the existing Tampermonkey UI Runtime Fixes and cached by the extension service worker.
- Original and Refined Light keep the native SquareCoil logo. A separate light-theme custom logo has not been supplied yet.
- Stable release metadata and GitHub Actions validation for both browser packages.

## Install for testing

### Microsoft Edge

1. Extract `SquareCoil-Companion-v0.7.0-EDGE.zip`.
2. Open `edge://extensions`.
3. Enable Developer mode.
4. Choose **Load unpacked**.
5. Select the extracted folder containing `manifest.json`.

### Google Chrome

1. Extract `SquareCoil-Companion-v0.7.0-CHROME.zip`.
2. Open `chrome://extensions`.
3. Enable Developer mode.
4. Choose **Load unpacked**.
5. Select the extracted folder containing `manifest.json`.

The Edge and Chrome packages intentionally contain the same extension source. Separate artifacts make installation and release tracking explicit without maintaining divergent code.

## Architecture

- `manifest.json`: MV3 package contract.
- `background.js`: timer bootstrapping, release metadata/update checks, cached dark-logo fetch.
- `content/theme-controller.js`: persisted timer appearance, timer finish, website theme, and dark-logo application/restoration.
- `page/timer-runtime.js`: stable SquareCoil clock observation and timer state engine.
- `page/timer-controls.js`: settings/navigation control layer.
- `page/timer-workspace.js`: v0.6 Job Workspace behavior for pause/resume, links, archives, CSV, restore, and destructive history controls.
- `page/timer-surface.js`: v0.7 additive Solid/Glass UI layer and package-version display patch.
- `styles/site-theme.css`: v0.6 audited Refined Light / Sleek Dark base website paint.
- `styles/site-theme-v070.css`: v0.7 dark-outline/focus/logo audit overlay.
- `popup/`: extension popup controls for appearance, finish, and release status.
- `release.json`: current stable release metadata.
- `HANDOFF.md`: implementation context and continuation contract for a new chat or maintainer.

## Critical behavior boundary

SquareCoil remains authoritative for clock-in, project/department switching, and clock-out. The Companion observes the current SquareCoil context. Manual Companion Pause/Resume changes only the local timer state. Resume is allowed only when SquareCoil still reports the same job.

## Update model

Developer-mode installs must be reloaded after replacing files. Future Edge Add-ons and Chrome Web Store publication can use the same MV3 source, but store URLs are intentionally `null` until actual listings exist. `release.json` is informational metadata and remote JavaScript is never executed.

## Tampermonkey coexistence

During migration, ensure there is not a separately enabled historical `SquareCoil Job Timer Manager` userscript creating a second runtime. The extension detects an existing timer root/global and avoids injecting a second timer engine, but individually installed old userscripts can still create their own listeners or UI.

For full project continuity, read **HANDOFF.md before changing behavior**.
